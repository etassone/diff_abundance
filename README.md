Pipeline for Differential Abundance analyses

Scripts to prepare raw fastq sequences for differential abundance analyses using the Tophat/Cufflinks pipeline as well as the DeSeq pipeline 

Will add more info on file structure soon. 

RawReads - Create a file with RawReads for each experiment. You can change the naming convention but the script expects files to be named using "X.R1.fastq" and "X.R2.fastq".
