After running Tophat on your files, proceed to this script for running the DESEQ pipeline.

You will need the PATH to samtools 

In your main program folder (our example is BUGS)

cd /BUGS/
mkdir 2_Samtools_Sort

change the output of DIR to /BUGS/2_Samtools_Sort

The path to the alignments will be /BUGS/1_tophat_alignments

run the program by typing

./samtools_sort.sh
